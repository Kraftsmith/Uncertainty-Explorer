In a predictive setting, this plan is meticulously detailed and structured at the outset, with clearly defined phases, timelines, and deliverables. The goal is to minimize uncertainty by anticipating every aspect of the project, thereby allowing for strict adherence to the schedule and budget. In a hybrid setting, the project plan still serves as the central roadmap, but it incorporates elements of flexibility to adapt to changing conditions or new insights gained during execution.
